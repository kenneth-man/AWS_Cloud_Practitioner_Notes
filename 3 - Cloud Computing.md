# Section 3 - Cloud Computing

## **3 types of Cloud:**
- **Private Cloud** = Cloud services used by a single organization
- **Public Cloud** = Cloud resources owned and operated by the public
- **Hybrid Cloud** = Use servers on-premises to control sensitive assets and also use cloud services

<br>

## **AWS Global Infrastructure**
- ### **Region** = Geographic region; Multiple Independant Availability Zones
- ### **Availability Zone** = One or more Data Centers
- ### **Edge Locations/Points of Presence** = Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoints for **CloudFront**
- ### **Elastic IP** = Remapped between EC2 instances across AZs, incase of failure

<br>

## **Choosing AWS Region**
- ### **Compliance** = data governance and legal requirements
- ### **Proximity** = nearer to customers means reduced latency
- ### **Available services** = all services aren't available in every region
- ### **Price** = varies between regions
