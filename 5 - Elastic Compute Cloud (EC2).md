## **EC2 Instance**
- Virtual server in the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) that runs applications in AWS; IaaS
- ### **Security Groups** = Firewall for EC2 instances; controls what traffic is allowed in/out of EC2 instance
- ### **User Data** = **Bootstrap Script** launched at the first start of an instance to Install updates, software...
- ### Use when need for full control over and instance and DB; patching OS

<br>

## **EC2 Instance Types**
- EC2 Instance Naming Convention e.g. **m5.2xlarge**
	- **m** = Instance Class
	- **5** = generation
	- **2xlarge** = Size within the Instance Class
- ### **General Purpose (M, T, A)**
	- Balance between Compute, Memory and Networking
- ### **Compute Optimized (C)**
	- For tasks that require high performance
- ### **Memory Optimized (R, X, High Memory, Z)**
	- For tasks that process large data sets in memory (RAM)
- ### **Storage Optimized (I, D, H)**
	- For tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to a data set

	- Commitment to an amount of usage (e.g. paying upfront Â£X/hour for **1/3 years**)
	- Usage beyond commitment is billed at **On-Demand** price
